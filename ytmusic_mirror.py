"""Mirror Spotify playlists to same-named YouTube Music playlists.

Same contract as the Apple mirror: Spotify is the source of truth, pairs are
discovered by case-insensitive name, missing tracks are appended one call at a
time ordered by added_at ascending (most recently added lands last), tracks
gone from Spotify are removed behind the same safety rails.

YouTube Music has no ISRC, so matching is title/artist keys with the shared
fuzzy scorer. Auth is a captured-browser-headers file (`uv run ytmusicapi
browser --file ytmusic_browser.json`) — same pattern as the Apple tokens.
