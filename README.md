**Always-on playlist sync: Spotify → Apple Music, YouTube Music, and local
audio files (Jellyfin-ready) — with an optional bidirectional mode.** Set it up
once, and every playlist you curate on Spotify stays mirrored everywhere —
tracks added on Spotify appear on the other services in date-added order, tracks
you remove disappear, and an optional download mirror keeps offline copies
organized for your media server. Flip on [N-way mode](#bidirectional-n-way-sync)
and a change made on *any* provider propagates to the others.

## Web GUI (self-hosted)

Prefer clicking to editing `.env`? A built-in web app (FastAPI + a React SPA)
lets you connect each service in your browser, choose what syncs, run a pass on
demand, and watch every match/add/remove stream live.

```bash
docker compose up -d          # then open http://<host>:8080
```

Or run it directly:

```bash
uv sync
uv run uvicorn spotify_mirror.web:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
# frontend hot-reload during development: pnpm -C frontend install && pnpm -C frontend dev
```

- **Connect accounts in the browser** — one-click OAuth for Spotify and YouTube
  Music (you supply your own app's client id/secret once), guided token paste for
  Apple Music, an API key for Jellyfin. No hand-editing `.env`.
- **Pair playlists across services** — browse each service's playlists and
  explicitly link differently-named ones (e.g. Spotify "Workout" ↔ Apple "Gym
  Music"), overriding the default same-name matching.
- **Transfer a playlist one-off** — copy any playlist from one service to another
  (into a new destination or an existing one), watch it live, and review any tracks
  that couldn't be matched.
- **Live sync view** — a real-time feed of matches, adds, removals, and holds as a
  pass runs, with per-service counters.
- **Run now or on a schedule** — the web app owns the schedule and one-off runs;
  dry-run by default.
- **Responsive** — works on a phone.

> **Security:** the UI has no login and stores your service credentials on disk
> (owner-only under `data/`). Bind it to your LAN only — **do not port-forward it
> to the internet.** A password gate is the intended next step before any exposure.

The headless CLI below still works for anyone who prefers `.env` + cron / Task
Scheduler.

## Features

- 🔁 **True mirroring** — adds *and* removals, not append-only. Spotify is the
  source of truth; Apple Music and YouTube Music follow.
- ⇄ **Optional N-way sync** — bidirectional mode where a track added or removed
  on Spotify, Apple, *or* YouTube Music propagates to all the others, echo-free,
  behind the same removal guards.
- 🎯 **ISRC-first matching** — exact recording identity where available, with
  Unicode-aware fuzzy title/artist/duration fallbacks (feat-credit drift,
  "- 2015 Remaster" suffixes, non-Latin scripts all handled).
- 🗂 **Same-name pairing + auto-create** — playlists link by name; missing ones
  are created with the Spotify name and description copied.
- 📥 **Local download mirror** ([spotDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader))
  — one folder per playlist in Jellyfin's `AlbumArtist/Album` layout, tagged
  with cover art, plus an auto-updated `.m3u8` per playlist.
- 🕒 **Date-added ordering** — tracks are appended one by one, oldest first, so
  every mirrored playlist stays sorted by date added (newest last).
- 🛡 **Safety rails** — dry-run by default, per-pass add/removal caps,
  net-loss protection, empty-snapshot guard, fail-closed on expired tokens.
- ⚡ **Fast re-runs** — Spotify `snapshot_id` skip, hard identifier links, and
  resolution caches make steady-state passes near-instant; Apple and YT Music
  mirrors run in parallel.
- 🚦 **Rate-limit friendly** — jittered pacing, exponential backoff on
  403/429, sequential per-service writes.
- 🗃 **Ever-growing song archive** — every track ever seen is recorded in a
  local SQLite database (name, artist, album, ISRC, raw metadata, first/last
  seen).
- 🐳 **Runs anywhere** — Docker Compose loop, Windows Task Scheduler, or plain
  CLI.

## How it works

Every pass, for each selected playlist name that exists on Spotify:

1. Snapshot the Spotify playlist (tracks, ISRCs, added-at dates).
2. Reconcile the same-named Apple Music playlist (via the web player's
   amp-api) and YouTube Music playlist (via the official
   [YouTube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)) —
   concurrently.
3. Missing tracks are resolved (cached links → ISRC → scored search) and
   appended oldest-first; tracks gone from Spotify are removed behind guards.
4. Optionally, spotDL syncs a local audio folder per playlist.

For the opt-in bidirectional variant, see [N-way sync](#bidirectional-n-way-sync).

> This project previously synced the other direction (Apple → Spotify). That
> mode is gone; the old `synced_isrcs.json` / `apple_spotify_uri_cache.json`
> files are obsolete and can be deleted.

### Matching

Same hierarchy the cross-service tools use
([TuneLink](https://tommcfarlin.com/case-study-tunelink-matching-music-ai/),
MusicBrainz): **hard identifier → search → fuzzy score**.

1. **Cached link** — once a Spotify track is matched to an Apple catalog id /
   YT videoId, that link is stored and reused (immune to title drift).
2. **ISRC** — exact recording identity where the service exposes it (Apple).
3. **Scored search** — [RapidFuzz](https://rapidfuzz.com/) `token_set_ratio`
   (order-, subset- and decoration-tolerant) + Jaro-Winkler, over both the raw
   and **romanized** ([anyascii](https://github.com/anyascii/anyascii)) title
   and artist, anchored by duration. This handles, without hardcoding:
   - **Multi-artist credits** — Spotify lists every feature, services list the
     primary (`Arijit Singh, Ved Sharma, …` ↔ `Arijit Singh`).
   - **Title decoration** — `Tri` ↔ `Popeye (Bangladesh) - Tri (ত্রি) Official
     Music Video`; `(feat. …)`, `- 2015 Remaster`, `(From "…")`.
   - **Transliteration** — Cyrillic/Bengali/Greek/Arabic (`Камин` ↔ `Kamin`,
     `নেশার বোঝা` ↔ `Neshar Bojha`).
   - **Video-only tracks** — YT search falls back to the `videos` filter, since
     many Bangla/indie/OST tracks live on YT only as uploads, not catalog songs.

   The **duration anchor** unlocks the looser (decoration/subset) title match,
   so a different version (`Runaway - Piano Version`) or a wrong-artist cover
   isn't accepted when its length disagrees.

   **Known limit:** CJK (Japanese/Chinese) romanizes to a *Chinese* reading, so
   kanji/kana titles that a service stores only in native script may still miss.
   Tracks with no confident match are reported (`x Not on …`) and skipped.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13+ and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Active Apple Music subscription (for the Apple mirror)
- Spotify account (free is fine — the Spotify side is read-only)
- YouTube Music account (optional, for the YT mirror)
- Docker (only for the always-running container option)

## Install

```bash
uv sync
```

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in.

Required:

- `APPLE_BEARER_TOKEN`
- `APPLE_USER_TOKEN`
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`

Optional (defaults in `.env.example`):

- `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` — must match your Spotify app setting
- `PLAYLISTS` — comma-separated names to sync; empty = every same-named pair
- `SYNC_INTERVAL` — loop sleep (`900`, `15m`, `1h`)
- `MAX_REMOVALS` / `MAX_ADDS` — per-playlist per-pass caps (safety rails)
- `DOWNLOAD_DIR` — enable the local download mirror
- `APPLE_STOREFRONT` — Apple catalog storefront (default `us`)

## Spotify setup

1. Go to <https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard>
2. Create an app
3. Copy `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
4. Add redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`

The script only requests the `playlist-read-private` scope — it never modifies
anything on Spotify. (Collaborative playlists aren't visible under this scope;
add `playlist-read-collaborative` in `spotify_client()` if you need them.)

## Apple token retrieval

The two headers from `music.apple.com` are enough — no Apple Developer
account needed.

1. Open <https://music.apple.com> and sign in
2. Open DevTools → **Network** tab
3. Play any song
4. Filter for requests to `amp-api.music.apple.com`
5. Open any `GET` request and copy from **Request Headers**:
   - `authorization: Bearer eyJ...` → `APPLE_BEARER_TOKEN` (the `eyJ...` part,
     without the `Bearer ` prefix)
   - `media-user-token: ...` → `APPLE_USER_TOKEN` (full value)

If either token expires (the bearer lasts months), the sync logs an auth error
telling you to repeat these steps. Update `.env` — a running loop picks up the
new values on its next pass (Docker needs a `docker compose restart`).

## Run

Default is a **dry run** — it prints every add/remove it *would* do and writes
nothing:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

Apply for real:

```bash
uv run main.py --execute
```

Useful flags:

```bash
uv run main.py --execute --playlists "Aurora,Chill"   # only these pairs
uv run main.py --execute --loop --interval 15m        # run forever
uv run main.py --execute --max-removals 100           # one-off larger cleanup
uv run main.py --execute --max-adds 500               # one-off larger backfill
```

First run opens a browser once for Spotify OAuth; the token is cached (default
`.cache`) and auto-refreshes afterwards.

## Always running: Docker

The container runs as **`omni-playlist-sync`** in the compose group
**`omni-playlist-sync`**, loops `--execute` every `SYNC_INTERVAL`,
and persists auth + caches in `./data`.

**Seed the Spotify token first** — the container can't open a browser, so it
needs a cached token at `data/spotify_token_cache`. Either copy the one a
direct `uv run main.py` already created:

```bash
cp .cache data/spotify_token_cache          # PowerShell: copy .cache data\spotify_token_cache
```

…or generate it fresh:

```bash
SPOTIFY_TOKEN_CACHE=data/spotify_token_cache uv run main.py
```

For the YouTube Music mirror, also put its auth at `data/ytmusic_oauth.json` and
set the OAuth env vars — see [YouTube Music mirror](#youtube-music-mirror-optional).

**Downloads**: set `DOWNLOAD_DIR` in `.env` to your host music dir (e.g.
`F:\Torrent\Music`) — compose bind-mounts it to `/music` in the container
automatically (the Windows path in `.env` is overridden to `/music` inside).
From Docker, `JELLYFIN_URL` should be `http://host.docker.internal:8096`.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f
```

## Always running: Windows Task Scheduler

Alternative to Docker — one-shot pass every 15 minutes, survives reboots:

```powershell
schtasks /Create /TN "SpotifyPlaylistMirror" /SC MINUTE /MO 15 `
  /TR "cmd /c cd /d D:\GitHub\omni-playlist-sync && uv run main.py --execute >> sync.log 2>&1"
```

Remove with `schtasks /Delete /TN "SpotifyPlaylistMirror" /F`.

Don't run the Docker container and the scheduled task at the same time — two
mirrors racing each other can briefly duplicate adds.

## YouTube Music mirror (optional)

The same mirroring (same-name pairs, adds oldest-first, guarded removals,
auto-create) runs against YouTube Music whenever its OAuth token is present — no
token, and the step just logs a skip line. It talks to the **official
[YouTube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)**, whose OAuth
refresh token is durable and survives restarts unattended.

One-time setup:

1. In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com), create a
   project, enable the **YouTube Data API v3**, then create an OAuth client of
   type **TVs and Limited Input devices**. Note its **client ID** and **secret**.
2. On the **OAuth consent screen**, set **Publishing status → In production** and
   add yourself as a test user. ⚠️ If you leave it in "Testing", Google expires
   the refresh token after **7 days** — the exact trap OAuth is meant to avoid.
3. Run the device flow and follow the printed code/URL (`uvx` runs it in a
   throwaway env, immune to a stale project venv):

   ```bash
   uvx ytmusicapi oauth --file data/ytmusic_oauth.json \
     --client-id "<CLIENT_ID>" --client-secret "<CLIENT_SECRET>"
   ```

4. Put `YTMUSIC_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `YTMUSIC_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`, and
   point `YTMUSIC_AUTH_FILE` at the token file (default `ytmusic_oauth.json`).

**Why the Data API, not ytmusicapi's internal endpoints?** `ytmusicapi`'s
private `youtubei` API rejects self-made OAuth clients outright (`400 —
INVALID_ARGUMENT`, a [known, unfixed issue](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi/issues/813)),
and its browser-cookie auth is a static snapshot Google invalidates within ~a
day. The public Data API accepts the OAuth token, shares YouTube's
playlist/video namespace (writes show up in the YouTube Music app), and refreshes
durably. `ytmusicapi` is still used, but only to refresh the OAuth token.

Notes:

- **Quota**: the Data API allows **10,000 units/day** (a search costs 100, an
  add/remove 50, a read 1). Steady-state upkeep is cheap; a big first-time
  backlog of *new* tracks can hit the cap and resume the next day.
- **Fidelity**: YouTube has no ISRC, so matching is title/artist/duration and
  resolution prefers `- Topic` art-tracks so tracks land as native songs. When
  no art-track surfaces, a music video is used instead.
- Only playlists owned by your account are edited; others are skipped.
- For Docker, put the token file at `data/ytmusic_oauth.json` (or whatever
  `YTMUSIC_AUTH_FILE` names).

## Bidirectional (N-way) sync

By default Spotify is the source of truth and edits flow one way. In **N-way
mode** every provider is a peer: add or remove a track on Spotify, Apple Music,
*or* YouTube Music and the change propagates to the others.

Enable it in `.env`:

```bash
SYNC_MODE=nway
PROVIDERS=spotify,apple,ytmusic   # which peers participate
```

**One-time cost — Spotify re-auth.** N-way needs to *write* to Spotify, which
adds the `playlist-modify-*` scopes. Changing the scope invalidates the cached
token, so you re-authorize once: delete the token cache
(`data/spotify_token_cache`) and run a pass so the OAuth flow re-runs (seed it
the same way as the [initial Docker token](#always-running-docker) — the
container can't open a browser). Until you do, N-way writes to Spotify fail
closed with a clear message.

**Always dry-run first.** Run without `--execute` and read the plan — it prints
every proposed add/remove on every provider before anything is written.

### How it stays safe

Bidirectional sync is impossible statelessly (you can't tell "added on A" from
"removed on B" without memory), so each logical playlist's canonical membership
is snapshotted after every clean pass. Each pass diffs every provider against
that snapshot, unions the changes, and reconciles everyone to the result:

- **Echo-free** — a propagated add becomes part of the snapshot, so it's never
  re-seen as a new appearance and bounced back.
- **Add-wins** on conflict — losing a song is worse than keeping an extra one.
- **Read-collapse guard** — if a provider suddenly reads far fewer tracks than
  the known baseline (a transient API hiccup), it's skipped that pass so one bad
  read can't cascade a mass-delete.
- **The same rails as one-way** — per-pass `MAX_ADDS` / `MAX_REMOVALS` caps and
  net-loss (`protect_removals`) hold on every write side.

### Cross-provider identity caveats

Matching uses ISRC where it exists (Spotify + Apple) and falls back to
title/artist/duration for YouTube (no ISRC). The fuzzy YouTube leg can
occasionally **duplicate** a track it fails to recognize as already-present, but
the guards mean it will **never wrongly delete** one. Big divergences converge
over several passes (bounded by the Data API quota).

## Local download mirror (optional)

Keeps an offline audio copy of each synced Spotify playlist, one folder per
playlist, via [spotDL](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader) (audio is
matched from YouTube Music). Sync is true mirroring: new tracks are downloaded,
tracks removed from the playlist are deleted locally. After each pass every
file's *Date Modified* is set to the track's Spotify added-at date — sort the
folder by Date Modified to get date-added order (newest last).

Enable:

```bash
uv tool install spotdl   # isolated CLI; or: pipx install spotdl
# ffmpeg required: winget install ffmpeg   (or: spotdl --download-ffmpeg)
```

Set `DOWNLOAD_DIR` in `.env` (e.g. `F:\Torrent\Music`) — runs as part of each
`--execute` pass. In Docker it works out of the box: that host dir is
bind-mounted to `/music` and used automatically (the image already includes
spotdl and ffmpeg).

The layout is Jellyfin-ready — point a Jellyfin music library at the download
dir and both the tracks and the playlists appear, staying updated every pass:

```text
<DOWNLOAD_DIR>\
  <Playlist>\
    <Playlist>.m3u8          # auto-(re)generated; Jellyfin imports it as a
    cover.jpg / folder.jpg   # the Spotify playlist cover, highest resolution
    <AlbumArtist>\           # playlist named after the file, in Spotify order
      <Album>\
        Artists - Title.mp3  # tagged + cover art embedded
```

**Newest-first ordering.** The `.m3u8` is written by this tool (not spotDL) in
Spotify **date-added order, newest at the top** — so Jellyfin shows your latest
additions first, like Spotify. Set `LOCAL_MIRROR_ORDER=oldest` to flip it. Each
file's mtime is also stamped to its added-at date (Date-Modified sort matches).
It's regenerated at the end of each `--execute` pass, *after* that playlist's
download finishes — so on a big first download it appears per-playlist as each
completes. To rebuild the `.m3u8` / covers / mtimes immediately from files you
already have, without downloading or syncing:

```bash
uv run main.py --refresh-local        # fast; no spotDL, no Apple/YT
```

**Resumable & incremental.** After the first full download, only the tracks
you *newly added* are fetched — spotDL is handed just those tracks' URLs
(`spotdl download`), so it skips the whole-playlist re-processing that `sync`
does. Tracks you removed are deleted locally (their emptied album folders are
pruned), already-downloaded files are skipped (`--overwrite skip`), and an
interrupted run just continues next pass. The Spotify playlist cover is saved
at the highest resolution Spotify offers and refreshed only when it changes.

**spotDL is only invoked when it's actually needed.** Per-playlist state in
`download_state.json` (Spotify `snapshot_id`, a track-id → file map, and the set
of tracks spotDL couldn't source) drives it: an **unchanged** playlist is
skipped outright; a **changed** one downloads only the genuinely **new** tracks
(by URL) and deletes the **removed** ones — it does *not* re-run for
permanently-unavailable tracks (OSTs / kanji titles / region-locked songs that
aren't on YouTube), which are remembered after the first attempt. So steady
state is fast: adding a song fetches just that song, not the whole playlist.
(Use `--refresh-local` to force-rebuild the m3u/tags/covers without downloading.)

**Metadata for Jellyfin.** spotDL embeds full Spotify tags + cover art on
download. On top of that, finalize **backfills any missing** tags
(title/artist/album/albumartist/ISRC) and cover art from Spotify — fixing the
occasional poorly-tagged file (e.g. a YouTube-sourced one) without overwriting
what spotDL wrote — and drops a `cover.jpg` in each album folder so Jellyfin
always has album art. Set `LOCAL_MIRROR_TAG_BACKFILL=0` to disable.

**Hard-to-find tracks.** spotDL falls back from YouTube Music to plain YouTube
(`LOCAL_MIRROR_AUDIO_PROVIDERS`), which recovers most OSTs / instrumentals /
indie tracks that aren't YT Music catalog songs. Some genuinely-unavailable
tracks still log `no audio source` and are skipped.

Optional env: `LOCAL_MIRROR_FORMAT` (mp3 default; changing it after the first
run orphans old files), `LOCAL_MIRROR_TIMEOUT` (seconds per playlist per pass,
default 3600), `LOCAL_MIRROR_ORDER` (newest/oldest),
`LOCAL_MIRROR_AUDIO_PROVIDERS`, `LOCAL_MIRROR_VERBOSE=1` (echo all spotDL output).

**Audio quality.** The source is YouTube, so without a logged-in YT Music
**Premium** account the ceiling is ~128–160 kbps — no `--bitrate` can add
quality the source lacks. For better results: `LOCAL_MIRROR_FORMAT=opus` keeps
YouTube's native ~160 kbps stream without an mp3 re-encode; and for genuine
256 kbps AAC, export a YT Music Premium cookie file (yt-dlp format) and set
`LOCAL_MIRROR_COOKIE_FILE=/path/cookies.txt`. `LOCAL_MIRROR_BITRATE` (e.g.
`320k`, or `disable` to copy the source) tunes the transcode.

**Playlist covers in Jellyfin.** Jellyfin *ignores* any cover file next to an
m3u playlist — it auto-tiles the tracks' embedded art. The only way to set a
real playlist cover is Jellyfin's API, so this is opt-in: set `JELLYFIN_URL`
and `JELLYFIN_API_KEY` (Jellyfin → Dashboard → API Keys) and each `--execute`
pass uploads the Spotify cover onto the matching Jellyfin playlist. The
playlist must already exist in Jellyfin (scanned from the m3u), so the flow is:
sync → Jellyfin library scan → next sync sets covers. From Docker, point
`JELLYFIN_URL` at `http://host.docker.internal:8096`.

Download-mirror caveats:

- **Private playlists fail** in spotDL's default auth — make mirrored playlists
  public/unlisted, or do one interactive `spotdl --user-auth ...` run;
  failures are logged per playlist and skipped.
- First run is slow (~10–30 s per track, YouTube throttling); later passes only
  touch deltas.
- Occasional wrong match (live/cover version) is inherent to YouTube sourcing.
- Renaming a playlist on Spotify starts a fresh folder; delete the old one
  manually. Each folder's `.sync.spotdl` is spotDL's sync state — keep it.
- Downloading audio this way is for personal use of content you have access
  to; it sits outside Spotify's ToS — your call.

## Caching & fast re-runs

Everything resolvable is cached so steady-state passes are near-instant:

- `apple_resolve_cache.json` / `ytmusic_resolve_cache.json` — ISRC and search
  resolutions, including misses (delete a file to force fresh matching).
- `spotify_tracks_cache.json` — each playlist's full track list keyed by
  Spotify's `snapshot_id`, so an unchanged playlist isn't re-paginated every
  pass. `snapshot_id` changes exactly when the playlist does, so there's no
  staleness (unlike a time-based cache).
- Apple requests reuse one pooled keep-alive connection per pass and back off
  on resets/429s — the fix for `ConnectionReset` under a big playlist's many
  calls.
- `song_cache.db → links` — Spotify id → Apple catalog id / YT videoId for
  every successful match. Hard identifiers beat title matching on later passes;
  delete a row if a linked id ever goes stale.
- `song_cache.db → sync_state` — after a fully clean `--execute` pass, each
  pair's Spotify `snapshot_id` is stored; while it's unchanged the pair is
  skipped entirely (logged as `unchanged since last clean sync`). Dry runs
  never skip and never write state, so `uv run main.py` always shows the full
  picture. Note: manual Apple-side edits on a skipped pair aren't corrected
  until the Spotify playlist next changes (YT-side edits are caught via track
  count).

## Song metadata archive

Every pass archives the metadata of every track it sees (all services) into
`song_cache.db` — a SQLite file that only ever grows. Tracks removed from your
playlists stay archived with name, artist, album, duration, ISRC, the full raw
snapshot JSON, and first/last-seen timestamps. Inspect it with e.g.:

```bash
sqlite3 song_cache.db "SELECT name, artist, album, first_seen FROM songs ORDER BY first_seen DESC LIMIT 20"
```

## Safety rails

Removals are destructive, so they're guarded:

- **Dry run is the default** — nothing changes without `--execute`.
- If Spotify returns 0 tracks for a playlist the target shows as non-empty,
  removals are skipped that pass (a transient API failure can't empty a
  playlist).
- More than `MAX_REMOVALS` pending removals in one pass → removals are skipped
  and logged; raise the cap deliberately if the change was intentional.
- More than `MAX_ADDS` pending additions → the rest continue next pass
  (giant one-burst backfills are what trip bot detection).
- Fuzzy title/artist protection: a target-side track that plausibly matches a
  Spotify track (metadata drift like `feat.` credits) is never removed.
- Net-loss protection: a target-side track resembling a Spotify track that has
  no match on that service is held (`~ held` in the log) — deleting it would
  drop the song with no replacement.
- Any Apple `401/403` aborts the pass immediately — no partial deletes on
  expired tokens. YT `403/429` rate limits back off exponentially and resume.

## Caveats

- Adding a catalog song to an Apple playlist may also add it to your Apple
  Music library — that's an Apple account setting ("Add Playlist Songs to
  Library"), not something the API controls.
- Tracks with no match on a service are reported (`x Not on ...`) each pass
  and otherwise skipped.
- Playlist cover art isn't copied — neither Apple nor YT Music exposes artwork
  upload; both auto-generate a mosaic cover from the tracks.

## Project layout

Runnable as `uv run main.py` (thin shim) or `python -m spotify_mirror`.

```text
spotify_mirror/
  cli.py         # entry: parse args, run once or loop
  runner.py      # build targets, run each in its own thread, then downloads
  config.py      # constants, env, CLI options
  spotify.py     # read-only source: client, playlists, tracks
  matching.py    # normalize / romanize / score / diff / removal guards
  archive.py     # SQLite: song archive + id links + snapshot state
  logs.py        # colourised, thread-safe, severity-tagged logging
  downloads.py   # spotDL local mirror + covers
  targets/
    base.py      # MirrorTarget interface + the shared mirror_pair loop
    apple.py     # Apple Music (amp-api)
    ytmusic.py   # YouTube Music (ytmusicapi)
```

**Adding a service** (Tidal, Deezer, ...): subclass `MirrorTarget`, implement
~8 methods (`list_playlists`, `playlist_tracks`, `track_id`, `resolve`, `add`,
`remove`, `create`, `is_editable`), and add its builder to
`targets/build_targets`. All the reconciliation — diff, ordering, safety rails,
logging, stats, snapshot-skip — is inherited from `base.mirror_pair`.

## Self-check

```bash
uv run pytest          # full test suite (in tests/)
```

## Troubleshooting

- `Missing required environment variable: ...` — fill in `.env`
- `Apple rejected ... (401/403)` — re-capture the two Apple tokens
- `YT Music mirror unavailable` — re-run the `ytmusicapi browser` setup
- Spotify OAuth redirect mismatch — the dashboard redirect URI must exactly
  match `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI`
- A playlist isn't syncing — confirm it's included in `PLAYLISTS` and exists
  on Spotify (targets are auto-created on `--execute`)
