"""Spotify — playlist source, and (in N-way mode) a writable peer.

By default only the `playlist-read-private` scope is requested and the tool
never modifies anything on Spotify. When built writable (N-way sync), the
`playlist-modify-*` scopes are added — which invalidates a read-only token
cache and forces a one-time re-auth. Track dicts produced here are the common
currency the mirror targets consume.
