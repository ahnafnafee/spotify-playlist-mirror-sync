"""Ever-growing local SQLite archive + resolution memory.

Three tables in one file:
- songs:      every track ever seen on any service (never deleted) — a durable
              metadata record with first/last-seen timestamps.
- links:      spotify_id -> target_id for every successful match, so later
              passes match by hard identifier instead of re-searching.
- sync_state: a playlist's Spotify snapshot_id after a clean pass, so an
              unchanged pair can be skipped wholesale.

SQLite over a pickle blob: incremental writes, crash-safe, and inspectable
(`sqlite3 song_cache.db "SELECT name, artist, last_seen FROM songs"`).
